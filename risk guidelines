Laws that currently exist that govern the cloud in its entirety are nonexistent. This has become one of the largest drawbacks for many organizations like BallotOnline who are considering migrating to the Cloud. Guidelines have been created by entities such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the International Organization of Standards (ISO) and the U.S. Department of Defense to help guide organizations properly and effectively manage risk. Of the many risk guidelines that exist, the ones that are appropriate for BallotOnline would be the ISO 31000 Standard and FedRAMP. 
ISO is responsible for combining expert knowledge to develop standards that serve as solutions to organizations operating across a number of industries. ISO 31000 is one of those standards. This standard details what effective risk management is, approaches, frameworks, philosophies and much more that can be applied by any organization to manage risk. BallotOnline would be able to utilize this standard in any integral part of the Cloud migration as well as a tool to gain familiarity with the Cloud. The standards expressed in ISO3100 are important for many organizations such as ours who are new to and still learning the Cloud. 
FedRAMP is very similar to ISO 31000. FedRAMP is “a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services” (Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board, 2013). FedRAMP is a way for organizations to ensure that they don’t have to repeat any steps while conducting security assessments if the frameworks are followed. FedRAMP’s framework was built on the basis of many other publications that formerly existing, such as NIST SP 800-37. FedRAMP is one of the best tools that we can use here in our migration to the cloud. FedRAMP’s framework can make our migration to the Cloud more seamless.
